This is my final project designed by Azure Dovel and myself. Its a dynamic website that uses 2 API's, boredAPI and Spotify, to generate a playlist based off of the activity that is given my boredAPI.

The user gives boredAPI some parameters, such as the amount of participants, the cost, the type of activity, and the accesibility. BoredAPI then generates an activity based off of these parameters. If the user likes the activity, they can choose to generate a spotify playlist for the activity. 

Unfortunately, boredAPI is no longer up and running, seeing as the original creator deleted the API, but you can still check out the files and the running website.
