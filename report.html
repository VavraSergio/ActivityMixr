        <li>This is the url to our GitHub repo which is shared among ourselves and with Proffessor Wang: <a
            href="https://github.com/wanghci/project-milestone-2-team-azuresergio">ActivityMixr GitHub</a> </li>
        <li>This is the url to our deployed application where anyone can try our app: <a
            href="https://wanghci.github.io/project-milestone-2-team-azuresergio/">ActivityMixr</a></li>
        <li>This project includes a report page that details how we met the requirements for the project in an ordered
          list that you are currently reading</li>
        <li>This project supports distinct layouts for both large and small screens using media queries, they are noted
          in the html for those pages</li>
        <li>This project contains 6 different pages, including this report page, that are meaningful, and are
          interlinked</li>
        <li>Right now we are thinking of using the <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/">Bored</a> and <a
            href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api">Spotify</a> APIs</li>
        <li>The site has a header for each of the pages</li>
        <li>The site includes a nav bar that has access to each page, additionally, the logo always links back to
          index.html</li>
        <li>The site includes multiple images that have alt attributes that describe the image contents</li>
        <!--might change pictures to figures and figcaptions-->
        <li>Each page and stylsheet is validated with no warnings or errors using Nu Validator and WAVE Web
          Accessibility Evaluator</li>
        <li>The site uses at least two different font faces, one for the header, one for the main.</li>
        <li>The site includes a form that is used to generate a playlist and activity for the user</li>
        <li>The site includes links to the spotify pregenerated playlists.</li>
        <li>Currently, we are thinking of making our network requests to use the Bored and Spotify APIs to generate a
          playlist. The user will enter a few different pieces of data using some forms, such as the amount of people,
          if they want it indoor or outdoor, the cost, things like that. We will then input that data into BoredAPI,
          and it will automatically generate an activity for the user. The activity that is then generated and
          displayed will be put into Spotifys API to generate a playlist and be shwon to the user as well.</li>
